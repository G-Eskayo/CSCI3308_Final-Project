# Server Configuration
# PORT: This specifies the port number on which your server will listen for incoming network requests. 3000 is a common default for local development in Node.js applications.
# HOST: This defines the hostname where your server runs. localhost is used for local development, indicating that the server is running on your local machine.
# NODE_ENV: This sets the environment in which your Node.js application is running. Common values are development, production, and test. This can change how your application behaves, for example, logging more information in development mode versus performance optimizations in production.

# Database Configuration
# DB_HOST: The hostname or IP address of your database server.
# DB_PORT: The port number your database server listens on. 5432 is the default for PostgreSQL.
# DB_USER: The username used to authenticate with your database.
# DB_PASS: The password used to authenticate with your database.
# DB_NAME: The name of the specific database on the server that your application will connect to.

# Authentication
# JWT_SECRET: A secret key used to sign JSON Web Tokens (JWT). This should be a long, random, and secure string. JWTs are used for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.
# JWT_EXPIRATION: The duration for which the JWT is valid. 1h means each token will expire after one hour.

# API Keys
# API_KEY_EXTERNAL_SERVICE: This is a generic placeholder for an API key required to authenticate requests to an external service. Replace EXTERNAL_SERVICE with the name of the actual service (e.g., GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY).

# Email Configuration
# EMAIL_HOST: The SMTP server address used to send emails.
# EMAIL_PORT: The port number used by the SMTP server. 587 is commonly used for TLS/StartTLS.
# EMAIL_USER: The username for authenticating with the SMTP server.
# EMAIL_PASS: The password for authenticating with the SMTP server.

# Logging
# LOG_LEVEL: Determines the level of logging that the application will perform. debug is a verbose level that logs a lot of information, useful during development.

# Feature Flags
# FEATURE_NEW_LOGIN: A boolean flag (true/false) used to toggle new features on or off without deploying new code. This allows for easier testing and rollbacks.

# External Services
# EXTERNAL_SERVICE_URL: The base URL for an external service API that your application might interact with.
# EXTERNAL_SERVICE_API_KEY: The API key for authenticating with the external service mentioned above.

# Redis Configuration
# REDIS_HOST: The hostname or IP address of the Redis server.
# REDIS_PORT: The port number the Redis server listens on.
# REDIS_PASS: The password used to authenticate with the Redis server, if required.

# Other Variables
# CUSTOM_VARIABLE: A placeholder for any custom variable you might need for your project. Replace CUSTOM_VARIABLE with a descriptive name of the actual variable and custom_value with the value you need to use.
