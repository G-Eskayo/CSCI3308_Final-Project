P.S we might not use some of these but it's just a rough idea of what might be used

Prerequisites:
- Javascript (Node.js)
- PostgreSQL for the database
- Official API *The steam API*
- HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap for front-end applications
- Containers will be using docker, so having the latest version of docker
- Git and Github for collaborative work with other members

To run the container using docker make sure the "docker-compose-yaml" file has the correct code to run properly (the code is given in the final project). Make sure 
that all other containers currently running are shut down in order to run current container for this project.
To run the test make sure the docker is running and open the localhost then start testing the code on your browser
